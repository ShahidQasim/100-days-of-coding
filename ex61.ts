//Making Enums for Vehicles: Lets create categories for vehicles like 
//cars, trucks, and motorcycles using enums, and show one example.

enum vehiclestype  {
    car,
    motorcycles,
    riksha,
    gadagari,
}
console.log(vehiclestype.car); ////enums start counting from 0 by default
console.log(vehiclestype.motorcycles);
console.log(vehiclestype.riksha);
console.log(vehiclestype.gadagari);
